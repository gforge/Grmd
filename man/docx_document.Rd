\description{
This function adds the option of having adaptations needed
for seemless integration with MS Word for importing
html-documents in the .docx-format. The advantage of html
documents is the ability to create advanced formatting
frequently needed in publications and that is available in
the \code{\link{htmlTable}} function. You can view
\href{http://gforge.se/2014-07/fast-track-publishing-using-rmarkdown}{the
series} for more details regarding how to achieve
fast-track-publishing (ftp) together with knitr.
